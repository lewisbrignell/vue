:: methods: {}

    the methods you know and love. they react to any DOM change


:: computed: {} 

    computed properties are like methods but are treated as static values.
    more efficient when dealing with specific changes; more context in how 
    they're fired
    computed properties have access to all data in your app's view

:: filters: {}

    filters like computed, are another type of function. filters don't have 
    the same access - they only have access to the values passed to them


:: directives: {}

    your own custom inline event directives like @click, etc.. !
    must always be prepended with 'v-'
    directives allow you to pass the focus element ( el ) to it easily
